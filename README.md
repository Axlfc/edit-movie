# edit-movie

#### TODO:
* Prove consistent horizontal-to-vertical video and vertical-to-horizontal logic
* Prove music video short based on images or video input can be edited and exported correctly (test data will come from [afaces-reel repo](https://github.com/afaces/afaces-reel) output)
* Functions to automate upload videos to Youtube (or YT shorts) to TikTok and IG reels automatically after being exported.
